Procgrok
=======

Concept code for 'polishing' process listings and providing a unified view

Procgrok steals heavily from the concept of logstash grok. We already know roughly what our process strings should look like so we can leverage that to polish output.

This returns an json object which could in theory be fed into couchdb or elasticsearch.
